    "## What is a REST API?\n",
    "A *Representational state transfer* (REST) API is a way of structuring an API so that, through the use of HTTP verbs (like GET and POST) one can get data. There are many HTTP verbs, but you are likely to run into the following the most\n",
    "+ *GET* - used when you are attempting to access a resource\n",
    "+ *POST* - used when creating a new instance of a resource\n",
    "+ *PUT* - used when attempting a _complete update_ of a resource\n",
    "+ *PATCH* - used when attempting a _partial update_ of a resource\n",
    "+ *DELETE* - used when deleting a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "_(For a complete list of HTTP verbs for those who are interested, the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) is very well written)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The URLs of the REST service are built to fit hand-in-hand with these verbs to create a logical sense of direction and destination. For example, consider the following sentences:\n",
    "> \"I would like to get a list of all messages in the database.\"  \n",
    "> \"I would like to create a new message\"  \n",
    "> \"I have a message ID, and I would like to get that message's information\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can turn all three of those into REST endpoints very easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ GET `/messages`\n",
    "+ POST `/message`\n",
    "+ GET `/message/:messageId`  \n",
    "_Note: This lab will be using the convention of prefixing \"slug\" values (values to be replaced by a program) with a colon. In the final example above, understand that `:messageId` is not literally part of the URL, but rather is to be replaced with a message ID._\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will be interacting with an example-built message board system using Python's built-in HTTP libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A quick note before we go forward - in the real world, you will normally see routes like we've shown in the example above, where the route is named after the resource you are getting/updating. We've chosen a solution for hosting HTTP routes for these labs that unfortunately doesn't allow us to name the routes as one normally would. Please understand that, where we have `/ca-get-messages` and `/ca-post-message`, the real-world ideal would be named just `/messages` and `/message` respectively."

    "In the REST world, there are two different HTTP verbs that represent updating data - `PUT` and `PATCH`. They both basically accomplish the same thing - their differences are more semantic than substantitive. `PUT` requests are for requests who require a representation of an entire object to be updated. This means the resource on the server will be completely and wholly replaced by what is being sent in the request. `PATCH` requests, on the other hand, allow for \"partial\" updates. This means only the fields provided in the request will be modified. There's a [really good Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28459418/use-of-put-vs-patch-methods-in-rest-api-real-life-scenarios) post about this if you really want to get into the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from your `GET` experiments that our messages have three fields: `id`, `message`, and `last_updated`. The server automatically generates the `id` field and, since it is the unique identifier for each message, we do not want to change this. The server is also responsible for updating the `last_updated` field, so the only field we need to be sending in our requests is the `message`. As such, we will be using `PATCH` to edit a message.\n",
