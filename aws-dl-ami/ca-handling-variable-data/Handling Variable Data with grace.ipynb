    "To understand what NoSQL is, let's quickly review what a traditional SQL database looks like. In a simple sense, SQL systems operate similar to a spreadsheet, where you have data arranged into columns, and each row is an entry. The columns are what _structure_ the data. Take a look at this example SQL relationship for an example \"Users\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| id (Primary Key) | username | first_name | last_name | creation_date |\n",
    "|------------------|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| a3ebcedff23f0ed  | mark123  | Mark       | Douglas   | 2020-06-16    |\n",
    "| f13240dccd2391a  | wumpus   | David      | Smith     | 2020-05-22    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column has a very specific \"type\" that it can hold - for example, the _username_ field will always be a string, whereas _creation_ \\ _date_ will always be a date object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as a thought experiment, let's consider that we wanted to expand our product, since users would like to be able to add in a link to their social media accounts. We can add, for example, a _facebook_ \\ _url_ column to our database, but for users who wish not to add this data, we will have to set this column to `NULL`. If we were only storing Facebook URLs, this is probably a sensible solution, however the user may wish to fill in their URL for their Github, Twitter, VK, etcetera. Most users will not fill out many of these, so we'd be wasting a considerable amount of space in our database by just having NULL values everywhere, and the process of adding yet another social media site to meet demand will become unfeasible. We'll see how NoSQL can address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most NoSQL systems (such as MongoDB, Google's Firestore, and especially Amazon's DynamoDB) replace the notion of a _row_ with a _document_. Each document will have an identifying value (similar to a primary key in SQL) and then, from there, any document can have any structure. This does **not** mean that NoSQL databases are unorganized messes - quite the opposite! Just because there is no set schema for a NoSQL database doesn't mean that you can't keep your data highly structured like you would in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's model what we had in the SQL database in a NoSQL system. Amazon DynamoDB still uses the notion of a \"table\" to store documents in, so here's what the \"Users\" table might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NoSQL Example 1](./assets/lab5/nosql-example-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the situation we were dealing with before, where we'd like to store a bunch of different social media site links for any given user. Say user `mark123` wants his Twitter and Facebook linked, but `wumpus` wants only a Github account linked. We can solve this by just adding the URLs to the respective user's document. This could look something like this:\n",

    "[According to Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/key-value/), DynamoDB is a _key-value_ based NoSQL system, which is somewhat similar to how JSON works. Each data value (such as a username or birth day) is stored with an associated key to identify it. In DynamoDB, keys and values can really be anything you want, though keys are usually strings so you can query data based on a human-readable word. In DynamoDB, an item/document has no limit to how many attributes it has as long as the size of all of its data does not exceed 400KB. These items live inside a table, which can have as many items as you need.\n",

    "Putting data into the database is great, but it's not really useful unless we can get data out of it.\n",
    "There are two ways of accessing data in DynamoDB - *querying* and *scanning*. Querying is much faster than scanning, since it can only be done on fields that are guaranteed to be on each object (in technical terms, it requires a primary key or sort key). In the example that we've been building, we could query off of the `id` field, since we've told DynamoDB that every entry to our database will have an `id`. However, for members like our `facebookUrl` which _are not_ guaranteed to be present on every item, we can use scans. Scans are slower since the entire table has to be searched through and filtered upon every scan - when you have millions of entries, scans should be limited to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we're just starting out with only a couple of entries, a scan will be perfect, since you can scan objects based on fields that not every item will necessarily have.\n",

    "Let's first do a scan on the `username` field - we'll try to access anyone whose username is \"wumpus\". We do this by telling our table to `scan()`. We can filter out items we don't want by passing in a keyword argument called `FilterExpression`. The DynamoDB library includes an object called `Attr` (short for \"attribute\") which allows us to build near-English filter requirements. Take a look at the example below:"
